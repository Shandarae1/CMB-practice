    <p>Welcome to our site! <br><br>My name is Shanda and I am a happy mom to four crazy kiddos. When I had my first baby I didn’t like the options available for baby books at the time. I decided I wanted to make him a book (with all my extra time, ha!) and designed all the pages and even handmade the cover. I loved it! After that I made several books for friends and family who have encouraged me to sell the books. I am now in my 15th year, and busier than ever. My business has been through a lot with me and both of us have grown so much. <br><br>Each of our books are lovingly handmade and feature pages that illustrate all the events surrounding a baby’s birth and first years. There is room for a picture on nearly every page plus extra pages for pictures and keepsakes. These books are unique and special just like the babies they were designed for.
