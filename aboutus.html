        Founded by brand new mom, Shanda Rae, in 2004 Custom Memory Book's mission is to help new moms find the perfect memory book for their precious little one.<br><br>

Our memory books have allowed families to document all the joyful milestones their baby passes with beautiful custom books and pages made just for them. We hope you'll take a look around, connect with us, and join us while we all jot down our favorite memories.
